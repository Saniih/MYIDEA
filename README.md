# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This AI-powered system aims to automatically detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity threats such as malware, phishing attacks, and network intrusions in real time. It will leverage machine learning to identify patterns of malicious activity and provide proactive recommendations or automated defenses to safeguard IT infrastructure.


## Background

Problem: Cybersecurity threats are becoming more sophisticated, frequent, and harder to detect using traditional security systems. These threats include malware, ransomware, phishing, insider threats, and network intrusions. The scale and complexity of cyberattacks are growing, making it difficult for manual systems and security teams to detect and respond effectively.

Commonality: Cyberattacks are widespread, affecting individuals, businesses, governments, and organizations worldwide. According to statistics, cyberattacks are increasingly frequent and target sensitive data, financial information, and critical infrastructure.

Personal Motivation: With the growing threat of cyberattacks, ensuring the security of data, systems, and networks is vital for organizations and individuals. I am motivated by the idea of using AI to enhance existing cybersecurity measures and help detect threats early, preventing major losses.

Importance: IT security is crucial not only to protect sensitive data but also to maintain the integrity of critical systems, prevent financial loss, and ensure the privacy of individuals. As cyber threats grow, AI can play an essential role in automating threat detection and improving the efficiency of responses.


## How is it used?

Context: The solution would be implemented in corporate IT environments, cloud infrastructures, and on individual devices. It would be integrated into network security systems, endpoint protection, and incident response tools.

Users:

Security professionals: Who would use the system to monitor real-time alerts and take further actions based on AI suggestions.
IT administrators: Who will configure the AI system and ensure it is functioning effectively, also tuning the system to better detect specific threats.
End users (corporate employees): Who benefit from proactive threat detection and automatic threat neutralization, reducing the need for manual intervention.

## Data sources and AI methods
Data Sources:

Network traffic data: Logs of incoming and outgoing network traffic to detect anomalies, such as unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts.
System logs: Logs from servers, devices, and other networked systems that contain valuable information about system behavior, errors, and potential threats.
Malware sample data: Datasets of known malware signatures or behaviors used to train models to identify malicious software.
Phishing data: Emails, URLs, and websites identified as phishing attempts for training and model validation.
AI Techniques:

Anomaly detection: Machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify unusual patterns in network traffic, system logs, and behavior that may indicate a cyberattack.
Supervised learning: Classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks) to classify threats based on labeled data (e.g., malware or phishing detection).
Natural Language Processing (NLP): For analyzing and detecting phishing emails, suspicious messages, or malicious URLs.
Reinforcement learning: To develop an intelligent agent that can take proactive actions (e.g., blocking access, isolating devices) to respond to threats based on real-time feedback.
The goal would be to train the model on historical data of known threats and normal behavior to enable it to detect and mitigate new or previously unseen attacks.

## Challenges

Data Privacy: Handling sensitive data, especially in the case of using network traffic and logs, raises privacy concerns. Data must be anonymized and securely stored.

False positives/negatives: AI models may misidentify benign activity as a threat (false positive) or fail to detect a real threat (false negative). Balancing detection accuracy is critical.

Adaptability: The AI system needs to be adaptable to emerging threats and changing attack patterns. Cybercriminals continuously evolve their tactics, making it important for the model to be constantly updated and retrained.

Scalability: Ensuring that the solution can scale across different types of IT environments, from small businesses to large enterprises, and handle vast amounts of network and system data.

## What next?

Growth: The system could grow to include advanced techniques like threat hunting and automated incident response. Integrating with security information and event management (SIEM) systems to provide a more comprehensive security posture would also be an option.

Integration: It could be integrated with blockchain technology for secure and transparent tracking of cybersecurity events or cloud security solutions for protecting data and applications hosted in the cloud.

Scalability: Expanding the solution to serve industries beyond IT, such as healthcare (detecting attacks on medical devices or patient data), banking (fraud detection), and government (detecting espionage and cyberattacks).
